## Congo News Summarizer


Over the past months, I have been collecting a lot of news articles from major Congolese news websites. I have those articles saved in a Postgres database. There is a lot of fun stuff I can do with them. Among them is a news summarizer. I want to analyze the daily news and find out what the websites are talking about.

In this project, I will try to build that news summarizer.

The first part of the project is documented [here](./notebooks/new-summarizer-clustering.ipynb)
